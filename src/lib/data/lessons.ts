 * Sample content library.
 *
 * Sourcing note: the stories below are simplified original retellings of
 * public-domain source material, written specifically for SeoJae Story so
 * that no modern, copyrighted translation is used anywhere in the app:
 *
 *  - "The Fox and the Grapes" retells a fable attributed to Aesop
 *    (traditionally dated ~6th century BCE); the fable itself and its
 *    core plot have been in the public domain for millennia.
 *  - "흥부와 놀부" (Heungbu and Nolbu) retells Heungbu-jeon (흥부전), an
 *    anonymous traditional Korean folktale of unknown authorship from the
 *    late Joseon era, also long in the public domain.
 *  - "The Gift of the Magi" is a simplified retelling of O. Henry's short
 *    story (first published 1905, Project Gutenberg #7256), long in the
 *    public domain. It opens the "Classics" collection (see CONTENT_BACKLOG.md).
 *  - "The Story of an Hour" is a simplified retelling of Kate Chopin's short
 *    story (first published 1894), long in the public domain — the second
 *    lesson in the "Classics" collection.
 *
 * The English and Korean text in every lesson — including all
 * translations — was written fresh for this app, so there are no
 * translation-copyright concerns. When you add more lessons, keep sourcing
 * from public-domain works (e.g. Project Gutenberg, Korean Wikisource /
 * Gongyumadang) and write your own translations rather than copying an
 * existing modern translation.
